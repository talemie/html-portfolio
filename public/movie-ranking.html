<h1>The Best Movies According To Temesgen</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all the time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The 100</h3>
<p>I like the ideas that they brought and <br /> The collection of all type of human kind are in there</p>
<h3>Sekaramu Posta</h3>
<p>I admired how they created the story and the way it ended ,<br /> Her life saved by the accidental posta which was almost lost</p>
<h3>Atse Mandela</h3>
<p>I love the idea that one of the character is playing i.e <br /> It said I'll die tomorrow so she was living as she gonna die tomorrow</p>
